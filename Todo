Open to do actions for SQL::Statement 1.xx

* Speed up join_2_tables:
  join_2_tables neither respect joins described in where_clause nor it
  left out unnecessary rows:

  Entire t1 will be cross joined t2 and than filtered.
  Proposals are welcome - even codeless, just ideas.
* Adding direct support for IN and BETWEEN operators to avoid "deep
  recursion" - it can be done so easy (now), just the parser has to be
  fixed a little ...
