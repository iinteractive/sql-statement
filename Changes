Changes log for Perl extension SQL::Statement

Version 1.26, release April 09th, 2010
----------------------------------------------

[Bug fixes]
* Handle NULL columns in concatenation as empty strings

[Improvements]
* Change regex's in parser to use \p{Word} instead of \w to allow unicode
  support

[Documentation]
* Make clear, that identifiers are handled case insensetive and there is
  a real good solution provided by DBI which allows to live great with
  that behaviour.

Version 1.25, release March 15th, 2010
----------------------------------------------

[Bug fixes]
* Keep org_table_names with schema information to allow derived
  table classes to handle as it seems reasonable there
* Separate columns with "\0" in multi-column aggregation to be able to
  difference between ('1','1foo') and ('11','foo')

[Misc]
* More resources added to META.yml

Version 1.24, release March 15th, 2010
----------------------------------------------

[Misc]
* Ignore *.rej in MANIFEST.SKIP (fixes RT #52081 reported by
  Lars Thegler)

[Bug fixes]
* Add missing import of _INSTANCE in SQL::Statement::Function::NumericEval
  fixes RT #52356 - reported by Detlef Pilzecker)
* Fix wrongly discarded DISTINCT clause (RT#53186)

[Improvements]
* Fix parsing errors of plain numbers (RT#16931)
* Fix parsing errors of nested calculation / functions (RT#16931, RT#52356)
* Rewrite result calculation of aggregation functions (simplify code, speed up)
* Upgrade Makefile.PL (patch from Alexandr Ciornii) to handle different
  EU::MM versions and abilities properly
* Update documentation to show how 'column_defs' and SQL::Statement::Term
  instances shall be used
* Introduce SQL::Dialect::Role providing ini-style data access to SQL::Dialects
  (patch from Michael Schwern)

[Things that may break your code]
* SQL::Parser now didn't deliver a struct containing 'column_names',
  'computed_columns' and 'set_functions' - it's combined into one member
  'column_defs'.
* Minimum required perl version is now 5.8 - upcoming next version of DBI
  requires perl 5.8, too - and I could simplify some code that's why

Version 1.23, release November 20th, 2009
----------------------------------------------

[Misc]
* Applied patch from Marc Espie which fixes several orthographic
  errors in SQL::Statement::Syntax documentation.
* Added a fixed version of test reported via RT #34121

[Bug fixes]
* Fix an issue in UPDATE command which 'shift's the values from
  the list of parameters which causes there're no more parameters
  left after first row get's updated (Fixes RT #50788)
* Fix aggregate function handling of new code since 1.21_01
* Correct handling of DISTINCT in aggregate functions

[Improvements]
* Add support for tables/columns starting with '_' for CSV and AnyData,
  which is usually forbidden by ANSI SQL
* Add support for inserting multiple lines with one statement
  (fixes RT #31730)
* Handle ANSI 'IS NULL' and CVS/AnyData 'IS NULL' different

[Things that may break your code]
* row_value now expects up to two arguments

  in joins

Version 1.21_6, release September 24th, 2009

----------------------------------------------

[Things that may break your code]
* When someone accesses the where_clause attribute of the SQL::Statement
  instance - be aware that now IN and BETWEEN can be native entries

[Bug fixes]

[Improvements]
* IN and BETWEEN are now native operations - they are not expanded
  to OR'ed equalize operations anymore

Version 1.21_2, release September 15th, 2009
----------------------------------------------

[Things that may break your code]
* modify behavior for unquoted identifiers - they're converted and
  returned lower cased now (instead upper cased as in 1.21_1)

  great improvements.
  Thanks Jens! -- Jeff

* Adding a lot of join tests (once from Jeff, 48 from
  PostgreSQL official handbook) - no error of them will be corrected in the
  first run
  Thanks to Alexander Breibach <alexander.breibach@gmx.de> -- Jens

Version 1.15, released 2 February, 2006
----------------------------------------
* fixed placeholder bug in SQL::Statement::UPDATE
  thanks for bug report Tanktalus

Version 1.14, released 21 April, 2005
----------------------------------------
 * fixed circular dependency in tests (one mistakenly required AnyData)

Version 1.13, released 18 April, 2005
----------------------------------------
 * pod fixes

Version 1.12, released 18 April, 2005
----------------------------------------
 * added support for GROUP BY
   (several people sent suggestions for this in the past, please email me
   so I can credit you, sorry I lost the names)

 * added support for true LIMIT - if a LIMIT clause is specified and
   no ORDER BY clause is specified, the SELECT will stop searching
   when the limit is reached;  with an ORDER BY clause it will still
   search the entire table because we can only ORDER a set;  using
   LIMIT without an ORDER BY will greatly increase speed

 * added support for CREATE/DROP keyword|operator|type|function

 * completely re-wrote the POD

 * fixed bug in primary key search optimization
   thanks for bug report and test scripts: Jim Lambert, <jimlambrtATmac.com>

 * added support for in-memory tables and heterogeneous operations,
   see the SQL::Parser docs

 * added many new built-in functions see SQL::Statement::Functions.pm

 * added support for user-defined functions, see SQL::Statement::Functions.pm

 * added support for column name aliases
       thanks for patch, Robert Rothenberg

 * added support for comparison to empty string (e.g. WHERE col1='')
   currently returns the same as WHERE col1 IS NULL
       thanks for patch, cpanATgoess.org

   BETWEEN as well as speed things up considerably

	SQL::Parser changes:
	- removed recursion from get_in(), get_btwn()

		nongroup_numeric(), nongroup_string()
		to remove scoped recursion
	- fixed nongroup_numeric() for case insensitive
		operator match
	- fixed nongroup_string, undo_string_funcs() to
		include user defined funcs
	- fixed ROW_VALUE's scan for user defined function
		argument separator scan

     * fixed function detection regex in SQL::Parser::ROW_VALUE
 	to accomodate arbitrary spacing

     * fixed SQL::Parser::SELECT_LIST()/extract_column_list()
 	to support concat operator '||' expressions

     * added following functions to SQL::Statement::Functions:
 	- COALESCE

   without adding extra flags to scripts

 * added support for SQL comments

 * added support for temporary tables and on commit clauses in
   CREATE statements and drop behaviour flags in DROP statements
   (SQL::Parser only, not supported by SQL::Statement)

 * fixed bugs in qualified column names (e.g. tableA.*), and in
   joins using ON or WHERE

Version 1.001, released January 17,2002
---------------------------------------

Fixed bug in UPDATE that caused the new value to be a hash
rather than a scalar.

This is the first CPAN release of the pure perl version of the
module.  It was previously released in an XS version by Jochen
Wiedman who has turned over maintenance of it to me.

The new Pure Perl version of SQL::Statement supports everything
supported by the XS version and, additionally, at least partial
support for the following features that are not supported at all
by the XS version:

 * Explicit and implicit joins
 * Table name aliases
 * Set functions
 * String functions
 * String concatenation
 * Numeric expressions
 * IN predicate
 * BETWEEN predicate
 * Alphabetic comparison in WHERE clauses
 * Ordering of text that looks like a number
 * Verbose error messages for both Parsing and Execution errors
